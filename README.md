# Waterinformatics

## Overview

- Worked in the Water Informatics Laboratory, **_AKCSIT, University of Calcutta_ funded by the _Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India_**
- Designed IoT-based prototypes to detect water leakage and measure water parameters such as flow rate, pH, and turbidity in real-time using sensors and NodeMCU microcontrollers
- Multicasted the sensed data to the cloud for further Time-Series machine learning analysis with the _ARIMA_ model using Python
