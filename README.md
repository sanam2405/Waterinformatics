# Waterinformatics

## Overview

• Worked in the Water Informatics Laboratory, **AKCSIT, University of Calcutta funded by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India**
• Designed IoT-based prototypes to detect water leakage and measure water parameters such as flow rate, pH, and turbidity in real-time using sensors and NodeMCU microcontrollers
• Multicasted the sensed data to the cloud for further Time-Series machine learning analysis with the _ARIMA_ model using Python
